# PredictNews - The Web Tools For Predict Fake News
Attention: Sixtas-sortcut is not the name of the application!

PredictNews is a website tool for predicting news. You can enter the URL or paragraph of the news that you want to check for correctness.

This tool uses Machine Learning technology - unsupervised learning which is very simple and still far from perfect. So don't trust this tool 100%, of course human instinct plays the biggest role in determining a decision.

You can access this application at the following link : [Predict News App](https://https://predict.up.railway.app)
